I decided to start a blog a long time ago, but never had the time to build one nor the resources.<br>
Some time ago I stumbled upon <a href="http://jekyllrb.com" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> a simple, static and blog aware site generator.<br>
Jekyll is really something for developers, using <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">Github Pages</a> to host and publish your website for free.<br>
Write posts (or content if you don't want a blog) in markdown, and publish with Git, easy as that.<br>

####What will be on this blog?
You won't read anything of my horrible days, walking the dog (which I don't have) in the pooring rain, NOO.<br>
I hate to read that shit on Facebook so I won't write about that here ("pfew", I hear you thinking).<br>
I'm a technology geek (sort of) so the contents of this blog will be mostly related to tech, privacy and laws.<br>
So if you like those subject, you may watch this space for what's about to come.<br>

####Features of this blog
I made this blog with Jekyll. I used <a href="https://github.com/plusjade/jekyll-bootstrap" target="_blank">jekyll-bootstrap</a> for some features and built my own theme on top of it.<br>
- Custom Redmaner theme<br>
- Sharing posts with Google+ and Twitter<br>
- Comments with Disqus<br>
- Sitewide Atom and RSS feeds<br>
- Full webapp support<br>
- Archive, Categories and tags<br>
- Great content!<br>

Thanks for your read, hope to see you around here more often<br>
~ Redmaner<br>
